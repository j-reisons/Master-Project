Preliminary results for Uc = 1.2 line do not seem to indicate a sharp transition from exponential size dependence
to size independence, but rather an increase of the exponential constant. Uc = Ub is it's own thing.
Eduardo is quite enthusiastic about the switch from steep - step function turning off of the current at Ub = 0 and
Ub roughly < 1 (as a function of time) to something that looks like power law for Ub > Uc.

Thw two main candidates for the point where this transition occurs are Ub = J and Ub = Uc. To distinguish them,
Let's perform the Uc = 1.5 line for Ub = [0.8:0.2:1.6].

Another important question is the characterization of low Uc vertical lines, for instance Uc = 0.5 . It seems plausible
that increasing the bath interaction would lead to a transition from ballistic to insulating, but where exactly? Let's do
that as well.

Uc = 0.5 transition seems to happen at Ub = 1 from ballistic to insulating, maybe diffusive at the boundary.

We need to characterize the boundaries more precisely. As I am getting a good feel for the diagram at this point, I will soon
need to get a few points in HD : bringing out the big bond dimensions. For this purpose it would be interesting to do some
real-world case profiling.

I need to do a profiling on the cluster for typical Bond-dimension and chain lengths instead of the N=10 D=50 that I had done.
It would be interesting to test Giacommo's NO-SVD approach versus the usual SVD in that context.

Long live NO-SVD : almost twice as fast for 2 freesweeps chain length 20/20 bond dimension 100.

The rough study of the system is basically over. I now need to get results as precise as possible for the various phase transitions
that I have found in order so as to have a clean, convincing presentation for a paper.

To begin, I should document the following lines :
	Ballistic to step-function isolating going from  Ub = 0.5 Uc = 0.7:0.1:1.3
	Ballistic to power-law isolating going from  Uc = 0.5 Ub = 0.7:0.1:1.3
	Step-function to power-law isolating going along Uc = 3 - Ub , for Ub = 1.5-3*(0.07071):0.07071:1.5+3*(0.07071)

To start out, let's do them all with Ub = 1.5 Uc , D_max = 500 , f = 2 , alpha = 0.8 .
