Last Friday I launched three computations for N=40 Uc=0 Ub=1,1. 

One with D=400 and the possibility for more iterative compression sweeps, giving 6 free sweeps. Not once has it changed anything. 
Perhaps I should allow 20 or 30 just to be sure that it never results in improvement.

The two others were with D=600. One with a ground-state and another with and X-state starting state. Unfortunately
both ran out of memory. I wrote a small script to estimate memory needs.

I wrote a memory-cheap implementation of apply-compress that recomputes MPO_MPS tensor elements on the fly when
they are needed, thus never storing the Large MPS.

Group meeting : decided to focus on the Uc = Ub line for now, and a line close to the Ub = 0 line to see if the diffusive Heisenberg point
opens up into more than a single point of diffusive behavior.

The initial results for 0.5 and 1.1 show system size independent behavior, but a qualitative change between current going to a constant positive
value or what seems to be 0 for 1.1. To be sure that the current converges to 0 longer chains and longer time dynamics seem necessary.
I have launched a bunch of them with bond dimensions 100, and Nb = 1.5*Nc .

Another thing to investigate was the phase dependence of the Z transport on phases of the XY state. Launched a XY state for comparison
with X state results.

Length 1.5 chains don't seem to quite converge to a stationary interface current, longer time evolution could be useful to characterize
it better. Nevertheless, I have measured the dependence of the currents at 0.8 of the time evolution wrt interaction.
It would seem that currents decrease monotonously with interaction, which was expected.

More interesting is the fact that discounting oscillations, current appears to be system-size independent for
interactions above and below 1, but there may be a small dependence at 1 : maybe a diffusive point.

Another interesting observation is the existence of two frequencies in the current at the middle of the chain.
There is the high frequency of the global "chessboard" pattern, that is observed in similar intensity across all
U (Jz values).
The other is a much lower frequency oscillation that looks like large blobs on the current figures. These blobs spread along the chain
as time goes on.
The intensity of this oscillation is monotonically decreasing with U .
At U = 0.5, it's frequency is 4 times lower than the fast oscillation.
At U = 0.8, it's frequency is 5/2 times lower than the fast oscillaion.

It would seem that the timescale for these large oscillations is 1/U and the small oscillations 1/J.

At U = 1.1, there seems to be a third oscillation that appears, of frequency even lower than the precious two.
Perhaps it goes as 1/(U-1) ???

Points to investigate - Related Jobs

To finish asymptotic current - Fourier datapoints:
Nc = 20:50, Nb = 1.5Nc , U=1.2:1.5 D=100,

To investigate if current goes to 0 or fixed value at U=1.1 , try larger bond dimension :
Nc = 30 , Nb = 45 , D = 200, U = 1.1 ;
