For the conducting-insulating transitions, I have drawn up the asymptotic currents, as well as standard deviation across
system sizes to illustrate system size dependence.

For the insulating-insulating transition, I have simply fitted exponentials on the decay of the current and see a 
change of behavior of the decay rate.


Starting the paper.

About making graphs for the paper :

A PRL column is 8 cm in width for text. Figures should be at most that width, most people seem to make them
7 - 8 cm wide. I should therefore aim to make my plots look good at that size.

For fonts, it seems that text is always a serif font, while most of the graph text is sans-serif.

Inkscape Font size 8 seems legible enough for this size, perhaps a little less is also useable.

Similar options can be specified using Matlab.

I should perhaps try using the subplot command for some of my things.
