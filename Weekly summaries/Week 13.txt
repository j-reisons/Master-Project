The next step seems to be to read litterature to obtain an idea of what to discuss. Whatever I decide to discuss,
it will be in relation to the rest of the litterature.

As a starting point, I should go through the bibliography of the Giacommo paper. It will largely end up being identical to
what I will cite, and it will provide context for what I am doing. So I guess this week is paper reading week.
