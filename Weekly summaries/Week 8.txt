Getting the results from the D=500 calculations started last week.

The question now is how to quantify/illustrate each phase transition from the data.

For the isolating-isolating transition, I need to perform fitting of the current as a function of time.
The questions are :
	- where to start and where to end?
		I was thinking cut from the start of the drop manually until about 0.4 or 0.45 Jt/Nb
		Perhaps just take bit where clearly power law and say what else is happening before.
	- what system sizes to investigate?
		Thinking only 50.
	- what fit functions to compare? We expect polynomial in the upper left, but what what to fit against the step function
	  of the upper right?


As for the ballistic insulating transitions, I need to perform finite-size scaling.
Actually I don't have to do finite-size scaling, I can tell another story.
The questions are:
 	- At what time of the evolution to perform the fit?
		Ideas : Jt/Nc = 0.5 (Jt/Nb = 0.33) as previous paper, or further in time Jt/Nb = 0.4 , 0.45
	- Do I use Current or dC/dt : which do we trust more?
		Just keep Current.
	- For Ub = 0.5 transition, the method will be analogous to the previous results for the Ub = 0 line.
	  For Uc = 0.5 we however go from ballistic through diffusive to an insulating phase with large oscillations and no clear scaling,
	  looks close to polynomial. What scaling do we propose to compare to polynomial, exponential again or something else?
		???
	- There seems to be a sharp drop at the start of some of the polynomials. Is it due to oscillations ? Do we do anything about it ? 



FORGET FINITE SIZE SCALING, TELL STORY OF ASYMPTOTIC CURRENTS AND POWER LAW TIME DECAY.
